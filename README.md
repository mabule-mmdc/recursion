# Recursion
In computer science, recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. Recursion solves such recursive problems by using functions that call themselves from within their own code. -[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science))

Here's an example of recursion in the form of [merge sort](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/data-structure-tutorial/merge-sort-algorithm#:~:text=of%20the%20subproblems.-,What%20Is%20a%20Merge%20Sort%20Algorithm%3F,sublists%20into%20a%20sorted%20list.) implemented in Java.

## Instructions
1. Compile by doing `javac Recursive.java`
2. Run by doing `java Recursive <args>`
    - `args` an arbitrary amount of integers as program arguments (ex. `java Recursive 5 4 7 1 8 9 2 3 6`)
